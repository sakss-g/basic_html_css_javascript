						Advancement of technology is a boon to us. It has been transforming lives in various ways. Technology is everywhere and sometimes we even use them without knowing that we are using them. 
						<br><br>
						Technology affects everyone in one or the other way. Similarly, for me technology is something when used properly can do wonders. Taking current situation as an example, due to the ongoing panademic, schools, offices, businesses were closed down but the use of technologies, virtual meeting, distance learning, work from home and many other things were made possible.
						<br>
						<br>
						During the time of the lockdown, there has been easy access to medicines, groceries, and household essentials with the help of technology like online shopping sites. Adding to this, technology has helped me to be connected with my friends and relatives with the use of social media.
						<br>
						<br>
						Education feels like a privilege, at this time of pandemic, as I still get to study with the help of online classes. But to the students in remote area where there is still lack of technologies and where physical classes were the only medium for education, really makes me think that the proper use of technology is indeed the way to development and a better future for all.
						<br>
						<br>
						Apart from this, entertainment is one of the things which has been easily acessible to me. There are many documenteries, movies and so many other things which are available online to keep one entertained.
						<br>
						<br>
						Getting to use technology has helped me to know the world, while still being at home. It has helped me to access information about the ongoing situation across the world. Having technology at our finger tips, is really an advancement towards developed future.
