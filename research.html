		<h2>Reference 1</h2>
			The first webpage taken as a reference is <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~fdc/sample.html">http://www.columbia.edu/~fdc/sample.html</a>. On openinig that web page we can see that there is no navigation bar (Image 1). On the contrary, we can see that my website makes the use of navigation bar for easy access to other webpages. But apart from that we can see the similarity in both such as the use of internal link (Image 2) to access the topic without scrolling all the way down. But once the user scrolls completely down in the reference web page, to reach to the top they again need to scroll back up where as in this website, the user is sent to the top of the web page by clicking on Go to Top.

		<h2>Reference 2</h2>
			The second web page taken as reference is <a href="https://www.cazinc.co.uk/">https://www.cazinc.co.uk/</a>. In that web page we can see the use of navigation bar in a different way. The navigation bar (Image 3) is shown while clicking on a icon (Image 4), where as my website uses the navigation bar which is visible at all time.

		<h2>Reference 3</h2>
			The third web page taken as reference is <a href="https://islington.edu.np/">https://islington.edu.np/</a>. In this reference website use of javascript has been done to make the image in the home page (Image 5) to change automatically within some interval of time. Similarly, the website which I have created has also used javascript to display images that automatically change in the home page.

		<h2>Reference 4</h2>
			The fourth web page taken as reference is <a href="https://ironspider.ca/forms/simpleform.htm">https://ironspider.ca/forms/simpleform.htm</a>. In this reference website a simple form has been shown (Image 6). Similarly in my website there is a feedback form which has used radio button as well. The form also displays a message when fields are empty. It also ha a rating section where user can give rating on different points and see the overall rating.

		<h2>Reference 5</h2>

In the reference website the blog (Image 6) has a simple formatting and everything is written in the same container where as in my website, in the blog section, different topics have different containers which are also accessible by internal links. The reference web page also has a feed back form in the same page where as the created website has a different page for the feedback
